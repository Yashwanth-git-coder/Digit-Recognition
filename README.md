# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project is a handwritten digit recognition application built using Python, GUI with Tkinter, and a neural network. It allows users to draw digits on the screen using a mouse and then predicts the digit drawn using a trained neural network model.

## Features

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.
- Handwritten digit recognition using a trained neural network model.
- Ability to draw digits on the canvas using a mouse.
- Prediction of the drawn digit with high accuracy.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd handwritten-digit-recognition
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Use your mouse to draw a digit on the canvas.

3. Click the "Recognize" button to predict the digit drawn.

## Neural Network Model

The neural network model used for digit recognition is trained on the MNIST dataset, which is a large database of handwritten digits. The model architecture consists of [specify your model architecture here, e.g., a convolutional neural network (CNN)].
